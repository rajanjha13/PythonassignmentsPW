        "# **Restful API & Flask: Questions and Answers**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. What is a RESTful API?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**REST** stands for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. It is not a protocol or a standard, but an architectural style for designing networked applications. An API (Application Programming Interface) that adheres to the principles of REST is called a **RESTful API**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key principles of REST are:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Client-Server Architecture:** The client (which initiates requests) and the server (which sends responses) are separate. This separation of concerns allows them to evolve independently.\n",
        "  * **Statelessness:** Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and complete the request. The server does not store any client context or \"session\" state between requests.\n",
        "  * **Uniform Interface:** This is a core principle that simplifies and decouples the architecture. It includes:\n",
        "      * **Resource-Based:** APIs are designed around resources (e.g., a user, a product). These resources are identified by URIs (e.g., `/users/123`).\n",
        "      * **Manipulation Through Representations:** Clients interact with resources through their representations, which are typically in JSON or XML format.\n",
        "  * **Cacheability:** Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable. This helps improve performance and scalability.\n",
        "  * **Layered System:** A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or to an intermediary along the way. This allows for layers like load balancers and caches.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Explain the concept of API specification.**\n",
        "\n",
        "An **API specification** (also known as an API schema or definition) is a formal, machine-readable document that describes the capabilities of an API. It serves as a contract between the API provider and its consumers.\n",
        "\n",
        "It defines:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Endpoints:** The available URLs (e.g., `/users`, `/products/{id}`).\n",
        "  * **HTTP Methods:** The operations allowed on each endpoint (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.).\n",
        "  * **Parameters:** The required and optional parameters for each request (in the path, query string, or header).\n",
        "  * **Request/Response Bodies:** The structure of the data that should be sent and received, usually in JSON format.\n",
        "  * **Status Codes:** The possible HTTP status codes for responses (`200`, `404`, `500`, etc.).\n",
        "  * **Authentication:** The required authentication methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Popular specification formats include **OpenAPI (formerly Swagger)** and **RAML**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Flask** is a **micro web framework** for Python. The \"micro\" in its name means it aims to keep the core simple but extensible. It doesn't come with built-in features like a database abstraction layer or form validation, leaving those choices to the developer.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's popular for building APIs because:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Lightweight and Minimalist:** It has a very small core and doesn't impose a rigid structure, making it fast to get started with.\n",
        "  * **Flexible and Unopinionated:** It gives developers the freedom to choose the libraries and tools they want for tasks like database interaction or authentication.\n",
        "  * **Extensible:** It has a rich ecosystem of extensions for adding functionality like ORMs (Flask-SQLAlchemy), authentication (Flask-JWT-Extended), and RESTful API frameworks (Flask-RESTful).\n",
        "  * **Easy to Learn:** Its simple API and excellent documentation make it very approachable for beginners.\n",
        "  * **Well-Suited for Microservices:** Its lightweight nature makes it an excellent choice for building small, independent services in a microservices architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. What is routing in Flask?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Routing** in Flask is the mechanism that maps URL paths to the Python functions that handle them. When a user navigates to a URL in your application, Flask's routing system determines which piece of your code should be executed to generate the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is primarily handled using the `@app.route()` decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "# This route maps the URL \"/\" to the home() function.\n",
        "@app.route('/')\n",
        "def home():\n",
        "    return \"This is the home page.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# This route maps \"/user/<username>\" to the show_user_profile() function.\n",
        "# The <username> part is a dynamic variable.\n",
        "@app.route('/user/<username>')\n",
        "def show_user_profile(username):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {username}!\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. How do you create a simple Flask application?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is the code for a minimal \"Hello, World\\!\" Flask application.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# To run this, save it as (for example) app.py and run `python app.py` in your terminal.\n",
        "# You will then be able to access it at http://127.0.0.1:5000/\n",
        "\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Create an instance of the Flask class\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Define a route and the view function to handle it\n",
        "@app.route('/')\n",
        "def hello_world():\n",
        "    return 'Hello, World!'\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Add a block to run the app when the script is executed\n",
        "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
        "    # debug=True enables auto-reloading and a helpful debugger\n",
        "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?**\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP methods (or \"verbs\") define the action to be performed on a resource. The most common ones in RESTful APIs are:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **`GET`**: Retrieve a representation of a resource. (e.g., get a user's profile). This is a safe and idempotent method.\n",
        "  * **`POST`**: Create a new resource. (e.g., create a new user). This is not idempotent.\n",
        "  * **`PUT`**: Update an existing resource completely. The request payload contains the full new representation of the resource. (e.g., replace a user's entire profile). This is idempotent.\n",
        "  * **`PATCH`**: Partially update an existing resource. The request payload contains only the changes to be made. (e.g., change only a user's email address). This is not necessarily idempotent.\n",
        "  * **`DELETE`**: Remove a resource. (e.g., delete a user). This is idempotent.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **7. What is the purpose of the `@app.route()` decorator in Flask?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `@app.route()` decorator is Flask's primary tool for **URL routing**. Its purpose is to bind a Python function (called a \"view function\") to a specific URL path.\n",
        "\n",
        "When Flask receives an incoming HTTP request, it checks the URL path against all the routes you've defined with this decorator. If it finds a match, it calls the associated view function and sends its return value back to the client as the HTTP response.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also specify which HTTP methods the route should accept using the `methods` argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "# This route only accepts GET requests (the default)\n",
        "@app.route('/data')\n",
        "def get_data():\n",
        "    return \"Here is your data.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# This route accepts both GET and POST requests\n",
        "@app.route('/item', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n",
        "def handle_item():\n",
        "    if request.method == 'POST':\n",
        "        return \"Item created.\"\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "        return \"Item data.\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?**\n",
        "\n",
        "| Feature | `GET` | `POST` |\n",
        "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
        "| **Purpose** | To retrieve data from the server. | To submit data to the server to create a new resource. |\n",
        "| **Data Location** | Data is sent in the URL as a query string (e.g., `/search?q=flask`). | Data is sent in the body of the HTTP request. |\n",
        "| **Idempotency** | **Idempotent.** Making the same request multiple times has the same effect as making it once. | **Not idempotent.** Making the same request multiple times will create multiple resources. |\n",
        "| **Cacheability** | `GET` responses are cacheable by browsers and proxies. | `POST` responses are generally not cacheable. |\n",
        "| **Security** | Less secure for sensitive data, as parameters are visible in the URL, browser history, and server logs. | More secure for sensitive data, as it's not exposed in the URL. |\n",
        "| **Data Size** | Limited by the maximum URL length. | Can send much larger amounts of data. |\n",
        "\n",
        "### **9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask provides the `@app.errorhandler()` decorator to register a function that handles specific HTTP error codes or exceptions. For an API, you typically want to return a JSON response instead of the default HTML error page.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import Flask, jsonify\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "# A custom error handler for 404 Not Found\n",
        "@app.errorhandler(404)\n",
        "def not_found_error(error):\n",
        "    # The second value is the HTTP status code\n",
        "    return jsonify({\"error\": \"Resource not found\"}), 404\n",
        "\n",
        "# A custom error handler for 500 Internal Server Error\n",
        "@app.errorhandler(500)\n",
        "def internal_error(error):\n",
        "    return jsonify({\"error\": \"Internal server error\"}), 500\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/')\n",
        "def index():\n",
        "    # This will trigger the 500 error handler\n",
        "    x = 1 / 0\n",
        "    return \"This will not be returned\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common and recommended way is by using the **Flask-SQLAlchemy** extension, which integrates the powerful SQLAlchemy ORM (Object Relational Mapper) with Flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "The general steps are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Install the library:** `pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy`\n",
        "2.  **Configure the Database URI:** In your Flask app configuration, set `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` to point to your database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL).\n",
        "3.  **Create the SQLAlchemy object:** `db = SQLAlchemy(app)`\n",
        "4.  **Define your Models:** Create Python classes that inherit from `db.Model` to represent your database tables.\n",
        "5.  **Create the Tables:** Use `db.create_all()` to create the tables in the database based on your models.\n",
        "6.  **Use the Session:** Use `db.session` to add, commit, delete, and query records.\n",
        "\n",
        "See the next question for a code example.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Flask-SQLAlchemy** is a Flask extension that acts as a bridge, making it easier to use **SQLAlchemy** in a Flask application. Its primary role is to simplify configuration and session management.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key roles:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Integration:** It handles the setup and teardown of database connections tied to the Flask application context.\n",
        "  * **Simplified Configuration:** It reads the database connection string directly from Flask's configuration (`app.config`).\n",
        "  * **Session Management:** It provides a pre-configured `db.session` object for database transactions. You don't have to manage creating and closing sessions yourself; Flask-SQLAlchemy does it behind the scenes with the request lifecycle.\n",
        "  * **Helper Functions:** It provides helpful functions like `db.create_all()` and `db.drop_all()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "<!-- end list -->\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "# Configure the SQLite database, relative to the instance folder\n",
        "app.config[\"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI\"] = \"sqlite:///project.db\"\n",
        "# Create the SQLAlchemy extension object\n",
        "db = SQLAlchemy(app)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Define a model\n",
        "class User(db.Model):\n",
        "    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
        "    username = db.Column(db.String, unique=True, nullable=False)\n",
        "\n",
        "# This command would create the tables\n",
        "# with app.app_context():\n",
        "#    db.create_all()\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/user/<name>')\n",
        "def add_user(name):\n",
        "    new_user = User(username=name)\n",
        "    db.session.add(new_user)\n",
        "    db.session.commit()\n",
        "    return f\"User {name} added.\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?**\n",
        "\n",
        "A **Blueprint** is a way to organize a group of related routes and views into a reusable component. Instead of registering all routes on the main `app` object, you can register them on a blueprint. Then, you register the blueprint with the main application.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are useful for:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Modularity:** They allow you to structure your Flask application into distinct, self-contained components (e.g., a `users` blueprint, a `products` blueprint). This makes large applications much easier to manage.\n",
        "  * **Reusability:** A blueprint can be registered on an application multiple times with different URL prefixes.\n",
        "  * **Organization:** They help separate different parts of an application, improving code readability and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "<!-- end list -->\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# In a file named `users.py`\n",
        "from flask import Blueprint\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create a blueprint named 'users'\n",
        "users_bp = Blueprint('users', __name__, url_prefix='/users')\n",
        "\n",
        "@users_bp.route('/')\n",
        "def get_all_users():\n",
        "    return \"A list of all users\"\n",
        "\n",
        "@users_bp.route('/<int:user_id>')\n",
        "def get_user(user_id):\n",
        "    return f\"Details for user {user_id}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# In your main `app.py`\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "from users import users_bp\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "# Register the blueprint with the main app\n",
        "app.register_blueprint(users_bp)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **13. What is the purpose of Flask's `request` object?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The global `request` object (imported from `flask`) encapsulates all the data from an incoming HTTP request. It is a \"context local,\" meaning it's only available and valid during the handling of a single request.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its purpose is to give your view function access to all information sent by the client. Key attributes include:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `request.method`: The HTTP method of the request (e.g., 'GET', 'POST').\n",
        "  * `request.args`: A dictionary-like object containing URL query parameters (the part after `?`).\n",
        "  * `request.form`: A dictionary-like object containing data from a submitted HTML form.\n",
        "  * `request.json`: If the request's content type is `application/json`, this contains the parsed JSON data.\n",
        "  * `request.files`: Contains files uploaded with the request.\n",
        "  * `request.headers`: The request headers.\n",
        "\n",
        "<!-- end list -->\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import request, Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/search')\n",
        "def search():\n",
        "    # Accessing query parameters: /search?query=flask\n",
        "    query = request.args.get('query', 'default') # .get is safer\n",
        "    return f\"You searched for: {query}\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?**\n",
        "\n",
        "This involves combining several concepts: using `@app.route` to define the URL and `methods`, using the `request` object to get incoming data (if any), processing the request, and using `jsonify` to return a JSON response.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import Flask, jsonify, request\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "# A simple in-memory \"database\"\n",
        "tasks = [\n",
        "    {\"id\": 1, \"title\": \"Learn Flask\", \"done\": True},\n",
        "    {\"id\": 2, \"title\": \"Build an API\", \"done\": False}\n",
        "]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Endpoint to get all tasks\n",
        "@app.route('/api/tasks', methods=['GET'])\n",
        "def get_tasks():\n",
        "    return jsonify({'tasks': tasks})\n",
        "\n",
        "# Endpoint to create a new task\n",
        "@app.route('/api/tasks', methods=['POST'])\n",
        "def create_task():\n",
        "    if not request.json or not 'title' in request.json:\n",
        "        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing title'}), 400 # Bad Request\n",
        "\n",
        "    new_task = {\n",
        "        'id': tasks[-1]['id'] + 1,\n",
        "        'title': request.json['title'],\n",
        "        'done': False\n",
        "    }\n",
        "    tasks.append(new_task)\n",
        "    return jsonify({'task': new_task}), 201 # Created\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **15. What is the purpose of Flask's `jsonify()` function?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `jsonify()` function is a helper that creates a Flask `Response` object with the `application/json` mimetype.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its main purposes are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Serialization:** It takes a Python dictionary or list and serializes it into a JSON formatted string.\n",
        "2.  **Correct Headers:** It automatically sets the `Content-Type` header of the response to `application/json`, which is crucial for clients to correctly interpret the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "While you *could* manually use Python's `json.dumps()` and create a `Response` object, `jsonify()` is the standard, convenient, and correct way to return JSON data from a Flask view.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **16. Explain Flask's `url_for()` function.**\n",
        "\n",
        "`url_for()` is a function that **builds a URL for a specific view function**. Instead of hardcoding URLs in your application (e.g., in templates or redirects), you provide `url_for()` with the *name of the function*, and it returns the corresponding URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Maintainability:** If you change a route's URL in the `@app.route()` decorator, all the `url_for()` calls will automatically generate the new URL. You don't have to find and replace hardcoded links.\n",
        "  * **Clarity:** It's more descriptive to refer to a function by its name.\n",
        "  * **Handling Special Characters:** It automatically handles escaping of special characters.\n",

        "### **17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask has built-in support for serving static files. By convention, you should create a folder named `static` in your application's root directory. Any files placed in this folder will be automatically served by Flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "To link to a static file, you use the `url_for()` function with the special endpoint name `'static'` and pass the filename as an argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# In your HTML template (e.g., in a 'templates' folder):\n",
        "# <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='css/style.css') }}\">\n",
        "# <script src=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='js/main.js') }}\"></script>\n",
        "\n",
        "# Your project structure would look like:\n",

        "# |    |--- /js\n",
        "# |    |    |--- main.js\n",
        "# |--- /templates\n",
        "#      |--- index.html\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?**\n",
        "\n",
        "*(This is similar to Q2, with more focus on the \"how it helps\" aspect.)*\n",
        "\n",
        "An **API specification** (like OpenAPI/Swagger) is a formal contract describing your API's endpoints and data structures. It significantly helps in building a Flask API in several ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Clear Documentation:** It acts as the single source of truth for how the API works, which is invaluable for frontend developers, mobile developers, or any other API consumers.\n",
        "  * **Parallel Development:** Frontend and backend teams can work simultaneously. The frontend team can build against a mock server generated from the specification while the backend team implements the actual logic.\n",
        "  * **Automated Tooling:**\n",
        "      * **Client SDK Generation:** Tools can automatically generate client libraries in various languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.) from the specification.\n",
        "      * **Interactive Documentation:** Tools like Swagger UI can generate interactive API documentation where developers can try out API calls directly from their browser. Extensions like `Flask-Swagger-UI` make this easy to add to a Flask app.\n",
        "  * **Automated Testing:** The specification can be used to generate automated tests that validate that the API implementation conforms to the contract.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**HTTP status codes** are three-digit codes that a server returns with a response to indicate the outcome of the client's request.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are critically important in an API because they provide a **standardized, machine-readable way for the client to understand what happened**. Instead of trying to parse an error message string, a client can check the status code and know immediately if the request was successful, if there was a client-side error, or if a server-side error occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common categories and examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **2xx (Success):** The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.\n",
        "      * `200 OK`: Standard success response.\n",
        "      * `201 Created`: The request was successful, and a new resource was created (used with `POST`).\n",
        "      * `204 No Content`: The server successfully processed the request but has no content to return (used with `DELETE`).\n",
        "  * **4xx (Client Error):** The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.\n",
        "      * `400 Bad Request`: The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed JSON).\n",
        "      * `401 Unauthorized`: The client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.\n",
        "      * `403 Forbidden`: The client does not have access rights to the content.\n",
        "      * `404 Not Found`: The server cannot find the requested resource.\n",
        "  * **5xx (Server Error):** The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.\n",
        "      * `500 Internal Server Error`: A generic error message for an unexpected condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Specify `methods=['POST']` in the `@app.route()` decorator.\n",
        "2.  Use the `request` object to access the incoming data from the request body.\n",
        "      * `request.form` for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data (standard HTML forms).\n",
        "      * `request.json` for `application/json` data (most common for APIs).\n",
        "3.  Process the data (e.g., save it to a database).\n",
        "4.  Return an appropriate response, typically with a `201 Created` status code.\n",
        "\n",
        "<!-- end list -->\n",
        "\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **21. How would you secure a Flask API?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Securing a Flask API involves multiple layers:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Authentication (Who are you?):** Verifying the identity of the client. The most common method is **Token-Based Authentication**.\n",
        "\n",
        "      * **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** A client sends credentials (`username`/`password`) to a login endpoint, receives a signed JWT, and includes this token in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests. The **Flask-JWT-Extended** extension is excellent for this.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Authorization (What are you allowed to do?):** Checking if an authenticated user has permission to perform an action. This is often implemented with custom decorators that check user roles or permissions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Use HTTPS (TLS/SSL):** Always deploy your production API over HTTPS to encrypt all data in transit, preventing eavesdropping. This is typically handled by the web server (like Nginx or Gunicorn) in front of Flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Input Validation:** Never trust client input. Validate all incoming data (path parameters, query arguments, request bodies) to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Libraries like **Marshmallow** or **Pydantic** are great for this.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Rate Limiting:** Protect your API from brute-force attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) by limiting the number of requests a client can make in a given time period. The **Flask-Limiter** extension is a popular choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** If your API needs to be accessed by a web application on a different domain, you must configure CORS headers correctly. The **Flask-CORS** extension makes this easy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Flask-RESTful** is an extension that provides a framework for quickly building REST APIs in a more structured way than plain Flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its significance lies in the patterns it encourages:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Resource-Based Classes:** It promotes organizing your API around `Resource` objects. A resource is typically a class that maps to an endpoint (e.g., `/users/<id>`). You define methods on this class for each HTTP verb (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`), which keeps the logic for a single resource neatly grouped together.\n",
        "  * **Simplified Routing:** You add resources to your API using `api.add_resource()` instead of multiple `@app.route()` decorators for the same URL.\n",
        "  * **Request Parsing:** It includes a powerful request parsing module (`reqparse`) that helps validate and parse arguments from the incoming request body and query string. This helps ensure you are receiving the data you expect.\n",
        "  * **Content Negotiation:** It has built-in support for multiple response formats, though JSON is the default and most common.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, it adds a layer of structure and convenience specifically designed for the common patterns of REST API development.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "from flask_restful import reqparse, Api, Resource\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "api = Api(app) # Create the API object\n",
        "\n",
        "TODOS = { 'todo1': {'task': 'build an API'}, 'todo2': {'task': '?????'}, }\n",
        "\n",

        "# Add the Resource to the API and specify its route\n",
        "api.add_resource(Todo, '/todos/<string:todo_id>')\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **23. What is the role of Flask's `session` object?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `session` object in Flask provides a way to store information that persists across multiple requests from the same client. It behaves like a Python dictionary, allowing you to set and get values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its primary role is to **manage user sessions**. For example, after a user logs in, you can store their `user_id` in the session. On subsequent requests, you can check the session for the `user_id` to see if the user is logged in.\n",
        "\n",
        "By default, Flask's session is implemented as a **secure, cryptographically-signed cookie**. The session data is stored on the client's browser, but because it is signed with a secret key (`app.secret_key`), the client cannot modify its contents without invalidating the signature.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import Flask, session, request, redirect, url_for\n",
        "\n",
