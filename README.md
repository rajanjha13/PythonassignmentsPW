# 🐍 Python Assignments — Rajan Jha

Welcome to my **Python Assignments** repository!  
This space documents my learning and practice throughout my Data Analytics certification at **PW Skills**.

From simple scripts to hands-on data tasks and APIs, every notebook in this repo shows a step in my journey — from **Kolkata, West Bengal** to a future-ready data analyst! 🚀
