        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "Data structures are ways to organize, store, and process data in computer memory so it can be easily accessed and manipulated by programs. They are fundamental because they enable efficient data management and retrieval, which is crucial for building effective software.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable data types can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets).\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "my_list.append(4)  # List is changed\n",
        "Immutable data types cannot be changed after creation (e.g., strings, tuples, integers).\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "my_tuple[0] = 4  # This would raise an error\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are mutable (can be changed), while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed).\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists use [], tuples use ().\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are better for collections that may need to change; tuples are better for fixed collections.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs using a hash table. Each key is hashed to an index, allowing fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion by key.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "Sets automatically remove duplicate values and support fast membership testing and set operations (like union and intersection). Use a set when you need unique elements and don’t care about order.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "A string is an immutable sequence of characters. Unlike lists, strings cannot be changed after creation, and they only hold characters, while lists can hold any data type and are mutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "Tuples are immutable, so their contents cannot be changed after creation. This ensures the data remains constant and is not accidentally modified, supporting data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Python dictionaries are implemented as hash tables, allowing fast access to values by key.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "Yes, lists can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, and even other lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "Strings are immutable for efficiency and security. Any operation that modifies a string creates a new string object, which helps prevent accidental changes and allows strings to be used as keys in dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "Dictionaries allow fast access to values by key, making them ideal for lookups, mappings, and when you need to associate unique keys with values. Lists require searching through elements, which is slower for these tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "Sets automatically remove duplicates, so each element appears only once, regardless of how many times it was added.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "Use a tuple when you want to store a fixed collection of values that should not change, such as coordinates (x, y), RGB color values, or as keys in a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "For lists, in checks if a value exists among the elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "For dictionaries, in checks if a key exists among the dictionary’s keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
        "No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable. Any attempt to change an element will raise an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.\n",
        "A nested dictionary is a dictionary where values are themselves dictionaries.\n",
        "Example use case: Storing information about people, where each person’s data is a dictionary:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "people = {\n",
        "    \"John\": {\"age\": 27, \"city\": \"Boston\"},\n",
        "    \"Rebecca\": {\"age\": 31, \"city\": \"Chicago\"}\n",
        "}\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "Accessing an element by key in a dictionary is typically O(1) (constant time), thanks to the underlying hash table implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "Lists are preferred when you need to maintain order, store items without unique keys, or process data sequentially (like iterating over a collection).\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "Historically, dictionaries did not maintain order, so items could appear in any sequence. In modern Python (3.7+), dictionaries preserve insertion order, but retrieval is still by key, not by position. This means you access values by their keys, not by their order.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists retrieve elements by index (position).\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries retrieve values by key (name or identifier), allowing faster and more flexible lookups"
